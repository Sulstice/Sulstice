Hello, I'm Sulstice. 

#### Career Timeline:

My philosophy is: I like to tackle any job that defines itself as "challenging" will, most likely, probably be more fun. The more you learn the more you can connect the dots, and I feel like the hardest positions in life you learn the most. Don't exactly know where I will go next...
